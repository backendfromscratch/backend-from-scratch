# The API for Ana and Luis's shop

The guided project for [Backend from Scratch](https://backenddesdecero.com/en/): it starts in Phase 3, "Your first server", and carries on in Phase 4, "API design". Each folder is the project as it stands at the end of a lesson: if you get stuck, compare your code with the folder for that lesson.

You need Node.js 24 or later; the course uses 26 (with nvm, `nvm use` in the folder picks it). On Linux and WSL, Node 26 also needs the `libatomic1` library (`sudo apt install libatomic1`). In each folder:

```sh
npm install   # installs the dependencies (if there are any)
npm test      # checks that everything works
npm start     # starts the server (from folder 04)
```
